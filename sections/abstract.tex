BPMN is a commonly used diagramming language to visualize business processes. Executable process models are an effective tool for bridging the gap between IT experts, that are responsible for process automation, and domain experts, who have insight knowledge about the process at hand. This thesis explains best practices for modeling and transforming executable BPMN process models to make these expressive and readable. 

Based on this best practices, a list of suggestions that can be used to improve an existing BPMN model was formulated. 

Since some best practices are candidates for automation, a software was implemented as part of this thesis that can scan a BPMN model for violations of mentioned best practices. This software is freely available as an open source project on github:  \url{https://github.com/dsunaric/epms-service}. 

This thesis goes then on to demonstrate in a case study how the software can be used as an aid to implement the suggestions. The process used for this case study originated from a real live client registration process used in the telecommunication sector and was adapted to be used in this thesis.
