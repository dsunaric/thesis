BPMN is a commonly used diagramming language to visualize business processes. Executable process models are an effective tool for bridging the gap between IT experts, that are responsible for process automation, and domain experts, who have insight knowledge about the process at hand. This thesis explains best practices for modeling efficient executable BPMN process models and gives suggestions on how executable process models can be transformed to improve expressiveness and readability.  

Some of those best practices and suggestions can be automated, therefore a software was implemented as part of this thesis that can scan a BPMN model for violations of mentioned best practices. This software is freely available as an open source project on github:  \url{https://github.com/dsunaric/epms-service}. 

This thesis goes then on to demonstrate in a case study how the software can be used as an aid to implement the suggestions. The process used for this case study originated from a real live client registration process used in the telecommunication sector and was adapted to be used in this thesis.

In practice there may be cases where some of the suggestions mentioned in this thesis will not be suited (e.g. when activities have to be kept for legal reasons).
