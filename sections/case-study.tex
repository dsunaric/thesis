In the previous chapter a set of suggestions for improving a BPMN diagram where listed. As it was also mentioned, only a fraction of these improvements can be automated. 

This chapter will provide a example how the mentioned not automatable and automatable suggestions can be applied together to an existing BPMN model. 

\section{The example model}
The used BPMN model for this chapter will be a client registration process which is a real live process used in the telecommunication filed that was changed in order to be used in this thesis. The process model can be found in figure \ref{fig:example-process}
