abstract = {The foundation of a process model lies in its structural specifications. Using a generic process modeling language for workflows, we show how a structural specification may contain deadlock and lack of synchronization conflicts that could compromise the correct execution of workflows. In general, identification of such conflicts is a computationally complex problem and requires development of effective algorithms specific for the target modeling language. We present a visual verification approach and algorithm that employs a set of graph reduction rules to identify structural conflicts in process models for the given workflow modeling language. We also provide insights into the correctness and complexity of the reduction process. Finally, we show how the reduction algorithm may be used to count possible instance subgraphs of a correct process model. The main contribution of the paper is a new technique for satisfying well-defined correctness criteria in process models.}

abstract = { The adaptation, specially by means of a simplification process, of modeling languages
is a common practice due to the overwhelming complexity of most standard languages
(like UML or BPMN), not needed for typical usage scenarios while at the same time
companies don't want to go to the extremes of defining a brand new domain specific
language. Unfortunately, there is a lack of examples of such simplification experiences
that can be used as a reference for future projects. In this paper we report on a
field study aimed at the simplification of a business process modeling language (namely,
BPMN) for making it suitable to end users. Our simplification process relies on a
set of steps that encompass the selection of the language elements to simplify, generation
of a set of language variants for them, measurement of effectiveness of the variants
through user modeling sessions and extraction of quantitative and qualitative data
for guiding the selection of the best language refinement. We describe the experimental
setting, the output of the various steps of the analysis, and the results we obtained
from users. Finally, we conclude with an outlook towards the generalization of the
approach and consolidation of a language simplification method. },

architectures has led to the existence of large repositories of complex process models

Abstraction is a means to reduce the size and complexity of such models. The aim of
this short paper is to present a set of abstraction rules that may be used to simplify
complex BPMN process models while focusing on important process model elements (abstraction
objects), such as activities, data etc. The abstraction rules are applied to real
world process models.},

title = {Fundamentals of Business Process Management},
year = {2018},
isbn = {3662565080},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
edition = {2nd},
abstract = {This textbook covers the entire Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle, from
process identification to process monitoring, covering along the way process modelling,
analysis, redesign and automation. Concepts, methods and tools from business management,
computer science and industrial engineering are blended into one comprehensive and
inter-disciplinary approach. The presentation is illustrated using the BPMN industry
standard defined by the Object Management Group and widely endorsed by practitioners
and vendors worldwide. In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background,
the book provides dozens of examples, more than 230 exercises many with solutions
and numerous suggestions for further reading. This second edition includes extended
and completely revised chapters on process identification, process discovery, qualitative
process analysis, process redesign, process automation and process monitoring. A new
chapter on BPM as an enterprise capability has been added, which expands the scope
of the book to encompass topics such as the strategic alignment and governance of
BPM initiatives. The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience
of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context
of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management
and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and
its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the
class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying
website.}
